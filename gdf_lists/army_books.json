        "background": "Goblins are small creatures who dwell in the dark corners of Tyria, making homes where big folk don’t care to go. They rely on numbers and trickery to defeat more powerful opponents.\n\nGoblins have long sought to carve out a place amongst the people of Tyria, only to be either ignored or treated as pests by the other species. The Havoc Wars forced the tribes to unite, and briefly saw them treated with respect by the Grand Alliance, but this respect quickly faded and now the Goblins once more struggle to find their place amongst the big folk.",
